        <p>We had evidence that service teams were struggling to understand the Government Service Standard and how to apply it in the context of the Department for Education (DfE).</p>
        <p>We wrote a <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/apply-the-service-standard-in-dfe/introducing-apply-the-service-standard-in-the-department-for-education">design history post</a> which talks about the evidence, the problems and the user needs which we identified in early 2022.</p

          <p>We worked with people from across the different professions in DfE to create the guidance in the service... [Kerry and Adam]</p>
