You should consider the [Service Standard points for discoveries](link to /service-assurance/prepare-for-discovery-peer-review) for your project. 

The [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) helps you to build accessible, usable services and guidance. 

Once you've considered the standards, [book a discovery peer review](https://example.com) to get end of phase feedback and recommendations.
