The GOV.UK [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) can help you build accessible, usable services and guidance. 

You should consider the [Service Standard points for discoveries](/service-assurance/prepare-for-discovery-peer-review) for your project. 

Once you've considered the standards, [book a discovery peer review](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review) to get end of phase feedback and recommendations.
