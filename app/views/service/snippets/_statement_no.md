### Publish an accessibility statement to your service

All services must have an [accessibility statement](https://design.education.gov.uk/accessibility/accessibility-statements) by law, and you must publish it on your website, ideally, link to it in the footer.

You should review your accessibility statement annually to keep it up-to-date. You should also update the statement if you make any significant changes which mean a change to the level of conformance of your service to WCAG 2.2.
