### Make your service look like a DfE service

You must use the [blue DfE header](https://design.education.gov.uk/design-system/components/header) for your service and the font stack as detailed in the DfE design manual.

You must not use the GOV.UK header or GDS Transport typeface on services provided on education.gov.uk. This ensures the service meets the [requirements detailed by GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk).

### If you're in private beta

Testing a service on the education.gov.uk with a GOV.UK header and GDS Transport typeface, is acceptable during private beta. This is only permitted if it's known that the service will provided on a service.gov.uk domain in public beta and live.
