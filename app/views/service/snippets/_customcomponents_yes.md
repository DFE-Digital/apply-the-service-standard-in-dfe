### Share your design and speak to a head of profession
Speak to the relevant head of profession about any custom patterns or components.

Run a [design crit](/service-assurance/design-crits) for your service for feedback.

If you design a pattern or component to meet user needs thatâ€™s not in the [GOV.UK Design System]( https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) or DfE Design Systems, [contribute your design](https://design.education.gov.uk/design-system/contribute/) to the manual.
