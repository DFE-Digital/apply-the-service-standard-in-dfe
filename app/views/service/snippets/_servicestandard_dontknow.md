### Consider the Service Standard

You should review the [Service Standard points for discoveries](link to /service-assurance/prepare-for-discovery-peer-review) for your project. 

The [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) helps you to build accessible, usable services and guidance.

Once you’ve considered the standards, [book a discovery peer review](link to service start page) to get end of phase feedback and recommendations.

If you’re building something or testing prototypes, you may be in the alpha phase. In this case, you could have an [alpha peer review](/service-assurance/alpha-beta-peer-reviews). 

There are other types of assurance you can use in DfE to support your work, including design crits(/service-assurance/design-crits), team RAG reviews in your portfolio and a [crit or 2i](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/types-of-content-we-publish/reviewing-and-checking-content) on any content you’re producing.
