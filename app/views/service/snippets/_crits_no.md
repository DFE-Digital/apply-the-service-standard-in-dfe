### Organise a crit and 2i

Arrange a design crit with your team, or disciplines across relevant portfolios.
Consider a [content crit](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/types-of-content-we-publish/reviewing-and-checking-content) in DfE or xgov.

Ask content designers on the DfE Slack channel [#contentdesign](https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C6L4J5DK6) for a [2i](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/types-of-content-we-publish/reviewing-and-checking-content) for your content.
