### Speak to your DDT business partner

Contact your [Digital Data and Technology (DDT) business partner](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/lvewp00038/SitePages/DDaT-Business-Partners.aspx) to scope out everything you might need from DDT in DfE. 

For example, business partners can help to navigate the DDT governance process, or understand the current landscape of services in your policy area.
