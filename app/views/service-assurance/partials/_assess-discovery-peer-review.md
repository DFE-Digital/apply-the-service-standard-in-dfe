As an assessor you'll help a team understand if they've completed their discovery.

You'll consider whether they've made well-evidenced recommendations and are ready to move on to the next phase.

## The discovery peer review panel

A panel can be made up of user research, design, product or delivery and a technical role. Together, you'll provide a level of assurance for a team to decide if they need to stop or carry on.

As part of the panel, there will be a lead assessor, who'll be responsible for chairing the peer review and coordinating the report.

## Before a discovery peer review

Assessors will:

- read the supporting artefacts about the discovery. Start to think about questions you might ask
- take part in a pre-call, organised by the service assessment team, to do introductions and agree an agenda
- answer any questions or concerns the team may have

## During a discovery peer review

Assessors will:

- review the work of the discovery
- decide if the team have done enough to understand who the users are and their needs
- understand what the problem is
- understand priorities for the team
- determine if the team has things to work on in an alpha or should stop
- provide authoritative advice, guidance, and recommendations

## After a discovery peer review

Assessors will:

- write up any recommendations or outcomes [in the report](/service-assurance/complete-discovery-peer-review-report)
- submit the report, if you're the lead assessor
- provide any support needed after the peer review, along with any actions

You'll be supported by the service assessment team throughout the process.

## Example discovery peer review agenda

A discovery peer review is 2 hours long and can take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays.

You should agree in the pre-call with the team how the session will run. 

An example agenda might look like this:

| Time             | Action                     |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| 5 to 10 minutes  | Introductions and housekeeping |
| 45 minutes       | Team show and tell         |
| 10 minutes       | Break                      |
| 45 minutes       | Questions and answers       |
| 5 minutes        | Wrap up and next steps      |
