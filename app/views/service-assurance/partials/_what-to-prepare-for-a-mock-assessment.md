Consider the best way to tell the story and show the work of the phase the team are in. 

A mock assessment is an informal experience, and your slide deck doesn't need to be the finished thing. 

Think about how the assessors can help or support the team with identifying gaps or possible risks. 

Review the practical tips by phase in [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](/apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/) to help you prepare.

## What to expect during a mock assessment

### After you request a mock assessment

You'll receive an email with next steps. This includes how to share links to artefacts for the panel to read. Your artefacts give the panel an idea of what you've done so far and helps them to think about how they can best support the team. Share what you have as work in progress.

### One to 2 days before

The team will have a call with the panel. This is a chance for everyone to meet and agree what will happen during the mock assessment. 

User research, design, and tech will also have a call each with the relevant discipline assessor to provide a bit more context on each discipline's or share things they think will be useful for the panel to know.

### On the day

Mock assessments are 4 hours. Someone from each discipline within the team should attend. It can be of value for the rest of the team to attend as silent observers. 

The panel usually includes a user researcher, a designer (sometimes a mix of content, interaction, and service, depending on the service), a tech assessor, and a product or delivery manager. 

There may also be silent observers for learning and development opportunities.

How you want the mock assessment to run is for you and the team to agree with the panel. You could, for example, agree to have a 45-minute Show & Tell, followed by a conversation about how the team could refine their presentation and tell the story of the service. Or flag any risks or areas they would like advice on. 

A mock assessment will have a much more conversational feel compared to a service assessment. 

See an [example agenda](link).

### After the mock assessment

The panel will complete the mock report within 7 working days. The service assessment plus team will review and share it with the team. 

The mock report will include an overall [RAG (red, amber, green) status](link) for the service, plus a RAG status against the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), feedback, and any actions. Feedback should help prioritize what the team want to focus on before the date of the service assessment.
