Think about the best way to tell the story and show the work of the phase the team is in. This could be a mixture of Lucid boards, docs, and sketches.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
You can create a slide deck but remember to show the actual work done to build the service, rather than lots of pre-prepared slides. Use slides to set the context, for example, but keep the deck to a minimum.

## What to expect during a service assessment

### After you request a service assessment

You'll receive an email with next steps. This includes how to share links to artefacts for the panel to read. For example, strategy docs, Lucid boards, design histories, or slide decks.
You can add links to work in progress, it doesn't need to be finished, it just gives the panel an idea of what you've done so far.

### One to 2 days before

The team will have a call with the panel. This is a chance for everyone to meet and agree on what will happen during the assessment.

For larger projects, user research, design, and tech will also have pre-assessment calls with the relevant assessors.

### On the day



Service assessments are usually 4 hours but can vary. Some services may need less time, whereas larger services may need more. You can discuss your needs with the service assessment team as part of booking. 

Someone from each discipline within the team should attend. It can be of value for the rest of the team to attend as silent observers.

The panel usually includes a user researcher, designer (depending on the service, this could be content, interaction, or service design), tech assessor, and product or delivery manager.

There may also be silent observers from DfE or cross-government for learning and development opportunities.

How you want the assessment to run is for you to agree with the panel. You could, for example, agree to have a 45-minute Show & Tell, followed by sections to cover the problem area, users, hypotheses, and measures of success.
It's up to the team to decide whether you have questions throughout or at the end of the assessment. You can discuss this with the panel on the pre-assessment call.

### After the assessment

The panel will aim to give the team an overall outcome within 4 working days.

They'll then complete the report and the service assessment team will share it with the team within 7 working days.

The report will include an overall [RAG (red, amber, green) status] (link to Receive feedback and recommendations for SAs) for the service, plus a RAG status against the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), feedback and any actions.
