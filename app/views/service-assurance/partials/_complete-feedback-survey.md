After you've received the report, both the service team and assessor panel will get a survey to complete.

This gives everyone the opportunity to give feedback on the whole process from start to finish.

Giving feedback helps improve the assurance process for future teams.

We measure the user satisfaction of the:

- booking process
- discovery peer review or service assessment itself
- support and guidance around the discovery peer review or service assessment
