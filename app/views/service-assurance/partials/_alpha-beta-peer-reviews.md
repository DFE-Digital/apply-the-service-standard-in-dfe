An alpha or beta peer review is a 2-hour informal review of a team’s work in the alpha or beta phase.

If you’re in the discovery phase, go to [step 2: discovery peer reviews](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review).

Alpha and beta peer reviews are a way to get feedback and recommendations at either mid or end of phase.

Unlike a service assessment, a peer review will not result in the team stopping work based on the recommendations.

## Why have one

Peer reviews are not a mandated requirement from CDDO. They’re a chance to get feedback and advice from DfE colleagues.

Peer reviews use [the Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) as a guide to provide recommendations.

They can help you understand if there's anything you need to change or improve in a service before you move to the next phase.

You can also use them as a measure against the Service Standard before you have a service assessment. If you're doing this, it's a good idea to arrange your peer review 2 weeks before assessment.

## When to arrange an alpha or beta peer review

For a pre-service assessment check in, you should arrange the peer review approximately 2 weeks before the assessment date.


For an end-of-phase check in at alpha or beta, you should arrange the peer review 5 to 6 weeks in advance, so that volunteers are more likely to have time to be on the panel.

## Outcome of an alpha or beta peer review

After the peer review, you’ll have a conversation with the panel about how the service is currently meeting [the Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard).

You’ll also receive a more detailed report within 7 working days. This will include what the team has done well and recommendations.

## What to prepare for an alpha or beta peer review

Think about the best way to tell the story and show the work of the phase the team is in. This could be a mixture of Lucid boards, docs, and sketches.

You can create a slide deck but remember to show the actual work done to build the service, rather than lots of pre-prepared slides. Use slides to set the context, for example, but keep the deck to a minimum.

Review the practical tips by phase in [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/) to help you prepare.

## What to expect during an alpha or beta peer review

### Organise a panel

As soon as you decide that you'd like an alpha or beta peer review, you should arrange the panel.

It's the team's responsibility to do this. 

Choose roles across product, delivery, user research, design, and tech, either from within your portfolio or across DfE.

### Guidance for volunteer panel

You’ll need to make time to read any artefacts shared in advance. Plus, 2 hours for the peer review itself. 

As a volunteer panel, you should agree who the lead assessor is, to manage the agenda and timings. Plus, reviewing and sharing of the report. 

You’ll write a report with the rest of the panel, documenting what the team have done well and what the team need to explore. 

### One to 2 days before

Arrange a pre-call if needed.

If the panel has been to the service’s show and tells or governance calls, they may not need to do this. If they’re less familiar with the work, it can be useful for user research, design, and tech to have a call with the relevant panel member. This is a chance to provide context or share things you think will be useful for the panel to know.

Share any related artifacts with the panel.

This could include journey maps, user needs, personas, JIRA or Trello boards, design histories, prototypes, and roadmaps.

You can share work in progress; it doesn’t need to be finished. It just gives the panel an idea of how you work and what you’ve done so far.

### On the day  

Peer reviews are 2 hours. Agree a representative from each discipline who will answer questions and present as part of the review. The rest of the team can attend to observe.

How you want the peer review to run is for the team to agree with the panel. You could, for example, agree to have a 45-minute show and tell, followed by sections to cover the problem area, users, hypotheses and measures of success. 

It's up to the team to decide whether you have questions throughout, or at the end of the peer review. You can discuss this with the panel in advance.  

 

### After the alpha or beta peer review 

The panel will meet after the peer review to discuss observations.  

They'll then complete the report within 7 working days and share it with the team. 

The report will contain feedback and recommendations that consider the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard).
