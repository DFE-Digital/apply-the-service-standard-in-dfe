An alpha or beta peer review is an informal review of a team’s work. They're a way to get feedback and recommendations at either the middle or towards the end of a phase.

If you’re in discovery, go to step 2 [discovery peer reviews](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review).

Unlike a service assessment, a peer review will not result in the team stopping work based on the recommendations.

If you'd like a more light touch review, or something less formal, you could organise a [design crit](/service-assurance/design-crits).

[Book an alpha or beta peer review](/book).

## Why have one

Peer reviews are not a mandated requirement from [CDDO (Central Digital and Data Office)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office/about). They’re a chance to get feedback and advice from DfE colleagues.

Peer reviews use the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) as a guide to provide recommendations.

They can help you understand if there's anything you need to change or improve in a service before you move to the next phase.

You can also use them as a measure against the Service Standard before you have a service assessment. If you're doing this, it's a good idea to arrange your peer review in the middle of the phase you're in.

## When to book an alpha or beta peer review

You should arrange a peer review 5 to 6 weeks in advance, so that volunteers are more likely to have time to be on the panel.

## Outcome of an alpha or beta peer review

You’ll have a conversation with the panel about how the service is currently meeting [the Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard).

You’ll also receive a more detailed report within 7 working days. This will include what the team has done well and recommendations.

## What to prepare for an alpha or beta peer review

Think about the best way to tell the story and show the work of the phase the team is in. This could be a mixture of Lucid boards, docs, and sketches.

You can create a slide deck but remember to show the actual work done to build the service, rather than lots of pre-prepared slides. Use slides to set the context, for example, but keep the deck to a minimum.

Review the practical tips by phase in [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/) to help you prepare. 

## What to expect during an alpha or beta peer review

### One to 2 days before

The team will have a call with the panel.

If the panel has been to the service’s show and tells or governance calls, they may not need to do this. If they’re less familiar with the work, it can be useful for user research, design, and tech to have a call with the relevant panel member. This is a chance to provide context or share things you think will be useful for the panel to know.

Share any related artefacts with the panel.

This could include journey maps, user needs, personas, JIRA or Trello boards, design histories, prototypes, and roadmaps.

You can share work in progress, it doesn’t need to be finished. It just gives the panel an idea of how you work and what you’ve done so far.

### Guidance for volunteer panel

You’ll need to make time to read any artefacts shared in advance. Plus, time for the peer review itself. 

Similar to a service assessment, it is the lead assessor's responsibility to manage the agenda and timings, then review and share the report. 

You’ll write a report with the rest of the panel, documenting what the team has done well and what the team need to explore.

### On the day  

How you want the peer review to run is for the team to agree with the panel. You could, for example, have a 45-minute show and tell, followed by sections to cover the problem area, users, hypotheses and measures of success. 

Agree a representative from each discipline who will present and answer questions. The rest of the team can attend to observe.

It's up to the team to decide whether you have questions throughout, or at the end. Discuss this with the panel in advance.  

### After the alpha or beta peer review 

The panel will meet after the peer review to discuss observations.  

They'll complete the report and share it with the team within 7 working days. 

The report will contain feedback and recommendations that consider the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard).
