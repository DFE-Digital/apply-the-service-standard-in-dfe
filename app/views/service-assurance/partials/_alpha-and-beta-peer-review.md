An alpha or beta peer review is a 4-hour review of a team's work in the [alpha](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works) or [beta](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works) phase. 

It's a way to get feedback and recommendations at the end phase. 

Unlike a service assessment, a peer review will not result in the team stopping work based on the recommendations.

## Why have one

Peer reviews are not a mandated requirement from CDDO. 

They're a chance to get end-of-phase feedback and advice from DfE colleagues. Peer reviews use the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) as a guide to provide recommendations. 

They can help you understand if there's anything you need to change or improve in a service before you move to the next phase.

## When to book an alpha or beta peer review

You should request a peer review at least 6 weeks in advance so that the service assessment team has time to arrange an assessor panel.

## Outcome of an alpha and beta peer review

You'll have a conversation with the assessor panel about how the service is currently meeting the [Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). 

You'll also receive a more detailed report within 7 working days. This will include what the team has done well and recommendations.
