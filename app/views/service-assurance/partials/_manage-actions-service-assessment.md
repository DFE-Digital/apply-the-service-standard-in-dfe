Actions are things the team must do to help the service meet the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard).

If your assessment report contains amber or red-rated standards, there will also be a list of actions for the team. 

The assessor panel and heads of profession in DfE will support teams to complete any actions.

## What to do if you have actions for a red-rated standard

If your service has any red-rated standards, you’ll need to book a reassessment.

You should:

- focus on completing actions before moving forward
- review the actions as a team
- go back to the assessor panel with any specific questions
- prioritise actions in sprint planning
- book a reassessment
- demonstrate with support of the panel and heads of profession how you've met the standard

At your reassessment, the assessors will listen to the team talk through the actions they’ve resolved.

You'll then get a new report with outcomes for standards that have been reassessed.

### What to do if you have actions for an amber-rated standard

If your service has any amber-rated standards, you can continue to the next phase but will need to resolve any actions and demonstrate these at your next assessment.

You should:

- review the actions as a team
- build actions into sprint planning
- involve heads of profession or profession leads to address actions
- book your next assessment
- demonstrate how you’ve resolved the actions at assessment

If you have amber actions that you're unable to resolve before your next assessment, work with the assessors, heads of profession, or profession leads to demonstrate how you'll either mitigate the action or resolve it in the future. 

For example, an amber rating for an issue that you know you cannot resolve by your next assessment, but will add to your roadmap, ready for the next iteration.
