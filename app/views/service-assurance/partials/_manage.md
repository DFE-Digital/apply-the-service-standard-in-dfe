If you need to return to your booking application, you can continue with your draft in the Service assessment plus service.

Once you've submitted a booking request, the service assessment team will check it.

These checks can take about 3 working days. You'll receive an email explaining next steps.

## What happens next

You'll be able to manage the request online, for example, you can:
- add links to artefacts
- see who the assessors will be
- add details of the team attending the service assessment or peer review
- assign responsibility for the service assessment or peer review to someone else

Only Department for Education staff can book or manage discovery peer reviews or service assessments online. Staff include civil servants and contractors working in DfE.
