If you need to return to your booking application, you can continue with your draft in the Manage section of the service.

Once you've submitted a booking request, the service assessment team will check it.

These checks can take about 3 working days. You'll receive an email explaining next steps.

## What happens next

You'll be able to manage the request online, for example, you can:
- add links to artefacts
- see who the assessors will be
- add details of the team attending the service assessment or peer review
- assign responsibility for the service assessment or peer review to someone else

Only Department for Education staff can book or manage service assessments or peer review online.

Sometimes, a request might be rejected. If this happens the service assessment team will contact you.
