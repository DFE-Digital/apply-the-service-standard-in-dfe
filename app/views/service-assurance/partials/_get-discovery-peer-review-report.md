You'll receive an email when the report is ready to read. This should happen around 3 days after the peer review takes place.

See an [example discovery peer review report](link to report example).

## What to expect in a report
The report will contain 3 sections.

These include a summary of how the team has demonstrated an understanding of users and their needs. And, how the team has understood the problem space.

The discovery will also be given an overall red, amber green (RAG) status with a description of what this means. Including specific recommendations the team needs to action.

## Discovery RAG status descriptions

### Red
There are serious concerns or recommendations the team should address before continuing. The team may want to consider escalating issues or problems to their senior responsible officer or senior leadership team. They might want to consider stopping the discovery at this point.

### Amber
There are some recommendations. At this point, the team may want to look at whether or not they continue or revisit the purpose of the discovery. This may result in running another discovery or evidencing improvements in an alpha assessment.

### Green
The team is on the right track.
