A mock assessment is a practice run-through of a service assessment. 

Although you should treat the mock assessment as a real event, it can have a more relaxed and informal nature. 

You can book a mock assessment if you have a service assessment coming up and want to have an informal run-through. To check, for example, your slide deck is appropriate, or to flag any risks.

## When to book a mock assessment

You can book a mock assessment a couple of weeks before the date of your service assessment. 

Email the service assessment team at <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk</a> to arrange. 


## Outcome of a mock assessment

Mock assessments receive an informal mock report. 

The report follows the same format as a service assessment report but doesn’t give an overall outcome of ‘met’ or ‘not met’. Informal measures of ‘met’ and ‘not met’ are given against each of the 14 points of the Government Service Standards as advice to the team to prepare for their upcoming service assessment. You will receive the guidance report within 7 working days.

If the team and panel agree that the mock has gone well, there is the chance to formalize the mock and change it to a service assessment. This is the team’s decision.
