A mock assessment is a practice run-through of a service assessment. 

Although you should treat a mock assessment as a real event, it can have a more relaxed and informal nature. 

You can book one if you have a service assessment coming up and want to have an informal run-through in advance. To check, for example, your slide deck is appropriate, or to flag any risks.

## When to book a mock assessment

You can book a mock assessment a couple of weeks before the date of your service assessment. 

Email the service assessment plus team at <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk</a> to arrange. 


## Outcome of a mock assessment

You'll receive an informal mock report within 7 working days.

The report follows the same format as a service assessment report but doesn’t give an overall [RAG (red, amber, green) status] (link to Receive feedback and recommendations for SAs) for the service. 

It will include informal RAG measures, feedback and any actions against the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

If the team and panel agree that the mock assessment has gone well, there is the chance to formalize it and change it to a service assessment. 

This is the team’s decision.
