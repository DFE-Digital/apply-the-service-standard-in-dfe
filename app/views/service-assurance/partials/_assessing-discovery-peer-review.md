As an assessor you'll help a team understand if they've completed their discovery.

You'll consider whether they've made well-evidenced recommendations and are ready to move on to the next phase.

A panel can be made up of a user researcher, designer, product or delivery and a technical role. Together, you'll provide a level of assurance for a team to decide if they need to stop or carry on.

As part of the panel, there will be a lead assessor, who'll be responsible for chairing the peer review and coordinating the report.

Before the peer review you'll:

- read the supporting artefacts about the discovery. Start to think about questions you might ask
- take part in a pre-call organised by the service assessment team to do introductions and agree a peer review agenda
- answer any questions or concerns the team may have

At the peer review you'll:

- review the work of the discovery
- decide if the team have done enough to understand who the users are and their needs
- understand what the problem is
- understand priorities for the team
- determine if the team has things to work on in an alpha or should stop
- provide authoritative advice, guidance, and recommendations

After the peer review you'll:

- write up any recommendations or outcomes [in the report](link to complete the report)
- submit the report, if you're the lead assessor
- provide support if needed after the review with any actions from the peer review

You'll be supported by the service assessment team throughout the process.

## Example review agenda

A peer review is 2 hours long and can take place on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

You should agree in the pre-call with the team how the session will run, an example agenda might look like:

| Time             | Action                     |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| 5 to 10 minutes  | Introductions and housekeeping |
| 45 minutes       | Team show and tell         |
| 10 minutes       | Break                      |
| 45 minutes       | Questions and answers       |
| 5 minutes        | Wrap up and next steps      |
