There are 3 types of assurance which you can use to make sure we're spending public money or building the right thing in the right way.

## Team assurance

Team-level assurance methods can help you to make sure that you're doing the right thing.

Some examples of team assurance are:

- [design crits](/service-assurance/design-crits)
- [2i on content](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/types-of-content-we-publish/reviewing-and-checking-content#prior-to-the-2i-check)
- accessibility compliance using checklists
- automated tests when code is changed and deployed
- RAG (red, amber, green) reviews

## Departmental assurance

Outside of your team, department-level assurance methods are used to make sure you're following the required standards.

These are usually required to ensure we're meeting our governance requirements as a government department.

Some examples of departmental assurance are:

- [discovery peer reviews](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review)
- [DfE panel service assessments](/service-assurance/what-a-service-assessment-is#dfe-panel-assessment)
- Show & tells
- IT health check
- Spend control review

## Independent assurance

Using independent assurance methods outside of DfE provides an even greater level of assurance and in some instances is required.

Some examples of independent assurance are:

- [cross-government panel service assessment](/service-assurance/what-a-service-assessment-is#cross-government-panel-assessment)
- security audits or penetration testing
- accessibility audit
- cross-government peer reviews or design crits
