A service only needs an assessment if it’s a transactional service. If you’re working on a non-transactional service, go to [step 3: prepare for a peer review](link to step 3: peer reviews). 

A service assessment measures a transactional service against the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](/service-standard). 

A transactional service is any service which allows users to: 

- create or update information stored by government 
- exchange money, goods, and services 
- make a request 
- submit personal information that results in a change to a government record 

All transactional services need to have an assessment. Getting assessed is a condition of your cabinet office spend approval. 

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private and public beta and live phases. 

If you’re a transactional service in discovery, you should [book a discovery peer review](link to step 3: peer reviews). A peer review at discovery will help the team to understand what the problem is, priorities and whether you should move into alpha.   

## Cross-government panel assessment 

If your service has over 100,000 transactions per year or users of the service are from more than one government department, the panel will consist of cross-government assessors. 

Some non-transactional services may also need to be assessed by a cross-government panel, the service assessment team can advise on this. 

## DfE panel assessment 

If your service has under 100,000 transactions per year, the panel will consist of DfE assessors. 

If your service is non-transactional, it will have a [peer review](link to step 3).  

## When to book a service assessment 

You should request a service assessment at least 6 weeks in advance so that the service assessment team has time to arrange an assessor panel. 

## Outcome of a service assessment 

You will receive an overall outcome of ‘met’ or ‘not met’ for the ≈assessment within 4 working days.  
You will then receive a more detailed report within 7 working days.   

### What to expect in a report 

Your service will be given an overall outcome of ‘met’ or ‘not met’. 
Your service will also be given a ‘met’ or ‘not met’ against each of the 14 points of the Government Service Standard, with feedback on what the team has done well and what they need to explore or consider before their next assessment. 

### When to get reassessed 

If your service receives a ‘not met’ it will need to be reassessed against the standard points it didn’t meet. 
The team should work together to take the recommendations on board. Focus on how to show the changes in the reassessment.
