A service only needs an assessment if it’s a transactional service. If you’re working on a non-transactional service, go to [step 3: prepare for a peer review](/service-assurance/what-a-peer-review-is). 

A service assessment measures a transactional service against the [14 points of the Government Service Standard](/service-standard). 

A transactional service is any service which allows users to: 

- create or update information stored by government 
- exchange money, goods, and services 
- make a request 
- submit personal information that results in a change to a government record 

All transactional services need to have an assessment. Getting assessed is a condition of your cabinet office spend approval. 

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private and public beta and live phases. 

If you’re in discovery, you should [book a discovery peer review](/service-assurance/what-a-peer-review-is). This will help the team to understand what the problem is, priorities and whether to move into alpha.

## Cross-government panel assessment 

If your service has over 100,000 transactions per year or users are from more than one government department, the panel will consist of cross-government assessors.

Some non-transactional services may also need to be assessed by a cross-government panel. The service assessment team can advise on this when you book your assessment.



## DfE panel assessment 

If your service has under 100,000 transactions per year, the panel will consist of DfE assessors. 

If your service is non-transactional, it will have a [peer review](/service-assurance/what-a-peer-review-is).  

## When to book a service assessment 

You should request a service assessment at least 5 weeks in advance so that the service assessment team has time to arrange an assessor panel. 

## Outcome of a service assessment 

You'll receive an overall [RAG (red, amber, green) status] (link to descriptions of RAG status) for the assessment within 4 working days.

You'll then receive a more detailed report within 7 working days. Go to [step 6: after a service assessment or peer review](/service-assurance/recieve-assessment-report) for report details and how to act on recommendations.
