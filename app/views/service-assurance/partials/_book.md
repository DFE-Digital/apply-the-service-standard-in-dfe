## When to book
You should book your discovery peer review or service assessment so that it happens near the end of phase of the project.

You can also book an alpha or beta peer review as a check in against the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) in the middle of the phase you're in.

Try to give at least 5 weeks notice. This will allow the service assessment team time to arrange a relevant panel.

## How to book
Use the [Service assessment service](link to service). 

Only Department for Education staff can book discovery peer reviews and service assessments online. Staff include civil servants and contractors working in DfE.
