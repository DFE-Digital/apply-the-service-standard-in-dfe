## When to book
You should book your discovery peer review or service assessment so that it happens near the end of phase of the project.

You need to give at least 5 weeks notice.

This allows the service assessment team time to arrange the relevant panels.

## How to book
Use the [Service assessment plus service](link to service). 

Only Department for Education staff can book discovery peer reviews and service assessments online. Staff include civil servants and contractors working in DfE.
