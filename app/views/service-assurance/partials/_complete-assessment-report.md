The report should show how the service is meeting the [14 Service Standard points](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard). 

As an assessor, you will consider each standard point and give a [red, amber, green (RAG) rating](/service-assurance/complete-assessment-report/#give-the-service-a-rag-rating-for-each-service-standard) against each one. 

You will also detail any actions that the team must take, where a red or amber rating is given against a standard.

The report should also include an overall rating for the service, of how it’s currently meeting the Service Standard. The panel should work together to consider this, but it's the lead assessor’s responsibility to finalise the overall rating.

## Draft the report

During the assessment, work together with the assessor panel to gather your findings for each of the [14 Service Standard points](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard), and any actions for the team.

Do this in a way that suits you. For example, in a Word doc or the panel chat in Slack. Before adding your final notes to the report.

You could also add comments directly to the report in the service during the assessment. It will be the lead assessor’s responsibility to add the overall rating, review the report and submit it to the service assessment team.

### Give the service a RAG rating for each Service Standard

Following recent changes to [CDDO policy for service assessments](https://publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/service-assessment-process-update), services will be given a RAG rating for each of the 14 points of the Service Standard. 

Plus, an overall RAG rating for the service. This is instead of met or not met.

#### Red

In order for the service to continue to the next phase, it must meet the Standard and get CDDO spend approvals. The service must be reassessed against the points of the Standard that are red at this assessment.

#### Amber

Services that receive any amber recommendations will be able to move into the next phase. However, they must address these points within a 3-month timeframe. All amber recommendations must be addressed before booking the next assessment.

#### Green

Services that receive green ratings for all 14 Service Standard points can progress into the next phase.

### Add actions for red or amber-rated standards

For red or amber-rated standards, add actions to the report for the team to take, to help the service meet the standard. 

## What happens after the report is submitted

The service assessment team will check it before it’s shared with the service team.

If the service team accepts the report and there are actions they need to take before their next assessment, they may be in touch with the panel. This could mean having a follow-up call, or giving advice on a workshop depending on the actions that need addressing.

If the team challenges the report or asks for clarification for any of the points made, they’ll speak to the service assessment team. The service assessment team will then set up a meeting with the assessor panel.
