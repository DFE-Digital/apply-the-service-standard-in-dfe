The report should show how the service is meeting the 14 Service Standard points. 

As an assessor, consider each standard point, give feedback, and a red, amber, green (RAG) rating against each one. 

The report should also include an overall rating for the service, of how it’s currently meeting the Standards. The overall rating is the lead assessor’s responsibility to finalize.

## Draft the report

During the assessment, work together with the assessor panel to gather your findings for each of the 14 Service Standard points, and any actions for the team.

Do this in a way that suits you. For example, in a Word doc or the panel chat in Slack. Before adding your final notes to the report.

You could also add comments directly to the [report in the service] during the assessment. It will be the lead assessor’s responsibility to provide the overall rating, review the report and submit it to the service assessment team.

### Give the service a RAG rating for each Service Standard

Following recent changes to [CDDO policy for service assessments](https://publishing.service.gov.uk/government/publications/service-assessment-process-update), services will be given either a red, amber, or green (RAG) rating for each of the 14 points of the Service Standard. 

Plus, an overall RAG rating. This is instead of a met or not met.

#### Red

In order for the service to continue to the next phase, it must meet the Standard and get CDDO spend approvals. The service must be reassessed against the points of the Standard that are red at this assessment.

#### Amber

Services that receive any amber recommendations will be able to move into the next phase. However, they must address these points within a three-month timeframe. All amber recommendations must be addressed before booking the next assessment.

#### Green

Services that receive green ratings for all 14 Service Standard points can progress into the next phase.

## What happens after the report is submitted

The service assessment team will check it before it’s shared with the delivery team.

If the team accepts the report and there are actions they need to take before their next assessment, they may be in touch with the panel. This could mean having a follow-up call, or giving advice on a workshop depending on the actions that need addressing.

If the team challenges the report or asks for clarification for any of the points made in the report, they’ll speak to the service assessment team, who’ll set up a meeting with the panel.
