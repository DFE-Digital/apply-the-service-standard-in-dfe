The report should show how the service is meeting the [14 Service Standard points](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard). 

As an assessor, you'll consider each standard point and give a [red, amber, green (RAG) rating](/service-assurance/complete-assessment-report/#give-the-service-a-rag-rating-for-each-service-standard) against each one. You should take into account the context the team are working in and evaluate the [Service Standards](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) in a proportionate way. 

You'll detail any actions that the team must take, where a red or amber rating is given against a standard.

The report should also include an overall rating for the service, for how it’s currently meeting the Service Standard. The panel should work together to consider this, but it's the lead assessor’s responsibility to finalise the overall rating.

## Draft the report

During the assessment, work with the other assessors on the panel to gather your findings for each of the [14 Service Standard points](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard), and provide any actions for the team.

Do this in a way that suits you. Before adding your final notes to the report. For example, in a Word doc or the panel chat in Slack. 

You could also add comments directly to the report in the service assessment service during the assessment. It will be the lead assessor’s responsibility to add the overall rating, review the report and submit it to the service assessment team. They'll then forward it on to the service team.

### Give the service a RAG rating for each Service Standard

Following recent changes to Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO) policy for service assessments, services will be given either a red, amber, or green (RAG) rating for each of the 14 Service Standard points. 

Plus, you'll also provide an overall RAG rating for the service. This replaces using ‘met’ or ‘not met’.

#### Red

In order for the service to continue to the next phase, it must meet the Standard and get CDDO spend approvals. The service must be reassessed against the points of the Standard that are rated red at this assessment.

#### Amber

Services that receive any amber ratings will be able to move into the next phase. However, they must address these points within a 3-month timeframe. All amber recommendations must be addressed before booking the next assessment.

If a service receives 1 amber-or-red-rated standard, this means the overall outcome with be amber or red.

#### Green

Services that receive green ratings for all 14 Service Standard points can progress into the next phase.

### Add actions for red or amber-rated standards

For red or amber-rated standards, add actions to the report for the team to complete, to help the service meet the standard. 

For any standards that are rated red, the team will need to resolve identified actions and be reassessed against those standards. 

If an action is rated amber, the team can continue to the next phase, but should complete the actions within 3 months of assessment. 

## What happens after the report is submitted

The service assessment team will share the report with the service team.

If the service team accepts the report and there are actions they need to take before their next assessment, they may be in touch with the panel. This could mean having a follow-up call, or giving advice on a workshop depending on the actions that need addressing.

If the team challenges the report or asks for clarification for any of the points made, they’ll need to speak to the service assessment team. The service assessment team will then set up a meeting with the assessor panel.
