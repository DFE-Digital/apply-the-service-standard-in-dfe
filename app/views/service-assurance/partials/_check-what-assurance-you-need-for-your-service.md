Use this tool to answer some questions which will help you understand the different ways you can check your work.

It will provide an outcome which will provide guidance on best practices and meeting the Service Standard.

You can use this tool to:

- confirm if you need a service assessment or peer review
- determine if your work should be assessed by a cross-government or DfE panel of assessors
- understand what other types of checks you can do
- get guidance and resources tailored to your specific project

Anyone can use this service, at any stage of the project lifecycle. 

You may find it useful to use this tool at the start of a project to understand what you might need in future, and include the outcomes in your delivery plan.

You'll be able to save a copy of the outcome as a Word document for future reference.
