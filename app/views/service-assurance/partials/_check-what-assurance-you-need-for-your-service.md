Use this tool to answer questions to understand the different ways you can check your work in DfE.

It will provide an outcome which will include best practices to deliver projects, products and services. It will also provide guidance to meet the Service Standard.

You can use this tool to:

- confirm if you need a service assessment or peer review
- determine if your work should be assessed by a cross-government or DfE panel of assessors
- understand what other types of checks you can do
- get guidance and resources tailored to your specific project

Anyone can use this tool, at any stage of a project lifecycle. 

You may find it useful to use it at the start of a project to understand what you might need in future. You can include the outcomes in your delivery plan.

You'll be able to save a copy of the outcome as a Word document for future reference.
