### What to expect in a report

The previous ‘met’ and ‘not met’ outcomes have been replaced with a new red, amber, green [(RAG) rating](/service-assurance/get-assessment-report/#assessment-report-rag-status-descriptions). 

Your overall service and each of the [14 Service Standard points](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) will be given a RAG rating.

Assessors will take into account the context the team are working in and will evaluate the Service Standards in a proportionate way.

If any of the standard are given a red or amber rating, there will also be a [list of actions for the team](link to Manage actions page).

## Assessment report RAG status descriptions

### Red

This replaces the previous rating of ‘not met’. For the service to continue to the next phase, it must meet the Service Standard. 

You’ll be given a list of actions in the report to be reassessed against any points that have been rated red.  

### Amber

This also replaces the previous rating of ‘not met’, or ‘met with conditions’ that has been used in DfE.  

If you receive an amber rating, you can move into the next phase of delivery.  

You’ll be given a list of actions in the report for any standards rated amber. You must address these actions within a 3-month timeframe.  

All amber-rated actions must be addressed before you book your next service assessment. 

### Green

This replaces the ‘met’ rating. Services that receive green ratings for all 14 Service Standard points can progress to the next phase. 

There will be no actions recorded in the report.

## When to get reassessed

If your service receives a red rating for any of the standards, it will need to be reassessed against those points.

For any standards that are rated red, the team will need to:
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Focus on resolving the actions.</li>
  <li>Book a reassessmen.t</li>
  <li>Evidence how they have resolved actions and now meet the Service Standard.</li>
</ol>

## What happens next

Once you have accepted the report, it will automatically be published in the reports section (link to report section) in the service.
