As an assessor, you’ll provide an independent view on how the team has applied the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/) in their work. 

You’ll listen to the team talk through an overview of the service. This usually includes details of the service, who the users are and what they’re trying to do. 

You’ll consider whether the service is ready to move into the next phase of delivery. 

Assessments are a space for services to get expert advice and guidance from a panel of specialists. 

An assessment panel is usually made up of user research, design, product or delivery, and a technical role. Design could include interaction, service or content, or a mixture of the professions. Together, you’ll provide a level of assurance to check and support a team moving to the next phase. 

The lead assessor will be responsible for chairing the assessment and coordinating and submitting the report.


Before a service assessment you’ll: 

- read the artefacts shared by the team. You’ll find these in the [Service assessment plus service]() 

- review previous reports, such as a discovery peer review or previous phase assessment. You’ll be sent a link to these by the service assessment team 

- attend pre-assessment calls, organised by the service assessment team, to meet the team being assessed, agree the agenda and answer any profession specific questions or concerns 

 

At an assessment you’ll: 

- review the work of the team against the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/) 

- ask questions to support the team in demonstrating why they’ve built what they have and how they’ve met the standard 

After an assessment you’ll: 
 
- provide a [RAG rating] (link to RAG rating detail in Report page) for each of the 14 Service Standard points 

- detail any actions that the team must take, where a red or amber rating is given for that standard 

- work with the panel to determine an overall rating for the service assessment 

- add any other observations to the report, for example, what the team has done well 

You’ll be supported by the service assessment team throughout the process.
