A design crit is a critique of a piece of work, for example, content, a visual of a service, a mock-up or a prototype, or a user journey map. It’s a way to get feedback to make improvements.

Crits usually involve a mix of roles, including designers, user researchers, product managers, and developers, but they should be open to anyone to participate in.

## Why have one

Design crits help to identify and solve design problems. They can help to make sure that user needs are embedded in the design.

They also help a team to:

- [write and edit content consistently](https://design.education.gov.uk/content-design/types-of-content-we-publish/reviewing-and-checking-content#reviews-and-content-crits)
- design consistent user interfaces
- ensure the correct use of patterns and components are used
- improve collaboration
- encourage a culture of learning and sharing

Try to have crits as a regular way of working with your team and sharing work.

## How to arrange a design crit

Depending on who you’d like feedback from, schedule time with people in your team. You can also invite others from across the design community; you can share details of your design crit in the [#design channel on Slack](https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C7JG0399S).

Keep the crit short, no longer than 45 minutes; this gives you time to present your design, tell people what you want feedback on, and for people to provide feedback.

You can do crits in person, around a screen or wall, or remotely – via a Teams call.

Depending on how comfortable you are with receiving feedback, you may want to lead the session, or ask someone else to facilitate and you take notes. 

The idea is to listen and then work with the feedback that is most relevant, given the context and phase you are in.

## What to prepare for a design crit

To run a crit in person, print the designs in advance and stick them to a wall, ready for comments and post-its.

To run a crit remotely, create a Lucid frame of screengrabs for people to add post-its, or a Word doc of content. Choose the tools that help you show the work in the best way.

To run a crit remotely, if you’re looking at navigation, layout, or structure, use Figma or Lucid. If you’re critiquing words only, a Word doc is a good way to capture feedback.

## Run a design crit

If you’re doing a design crit with people outside your team, start by setting the context. Explain who the users are and their needs, any assumptions you’ve made, and what stage of delivery you’re at.

You could introduce rules to create a supportive space.

### Design crit rules

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Set the scene: everyone did the best they could at that time, with the skills, ability, and resources available to them.</li>
  <li>Talk about the product or content, not the person who created it..</li>
  <li>Use constructive criticism, be honest and kind.</li>
  <li>No one needs to defend a decision. We’re a team, working together.</li>
</ol>

After the crit, you decide what feedback you take forward. Think about what you want to test in research or which changes help to answer the user need.
