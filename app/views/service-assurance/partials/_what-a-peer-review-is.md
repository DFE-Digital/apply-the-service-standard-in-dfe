A service can have a peer review if it is a non-transactional service. If you're working on a transactional service, go to [Step 2: Prepare for a Service Assessment](/service-assurance/what-a-service-assessment-is).

A peer review considers how a non-transactional service is being built against the 14 points of the Government Service Standard.

If your service is a non-transactional service, it should have a peer review.

Peer reviews can happen at the end of discovery, alpha, and beta phases.

- Discovery peer reviews are 2 hours long and consider the service against Standard points 1 to 7
- Alpha and beta peer reviews are 4 hours and consider all 14 points of the Government Service Standard.

Choose the peer review that's relevant for the phase of your service.
