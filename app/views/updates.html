  <span class="govuk-body-s">On 17 May 2023 by Andy Jones, Head of Design</span>
</p>

<p>We have published a rebuilt version of the service which uses our new DfE Frontend and header style.</p>
<p>The previous version was built using the GOV tech docs manual template and published to GitHub pages. We had identified a problem with using GitHub pages and as a result have rebuilt the codebaseand moved away from this solution.</p>
<p>Being able to do this, means it's easier to contribute to and manage change publishing through a new pipeline process.</p>
<p>For information, we haven't updated any of the guidance.</p>
