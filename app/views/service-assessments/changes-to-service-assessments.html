                The <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/design-ops" target="_blank">DesignOps team</a> are building a new service to find out about and assure digital projects and services in DfE.

                The Service assessment service will include guidance to find out about, book, and report on assessments and peer reviews. From discovery peer reviews to service assessments.

                The service will be used by service teams, assessors and the service assessment team. All of who are involved as either stakeholders or users of the service in research.
