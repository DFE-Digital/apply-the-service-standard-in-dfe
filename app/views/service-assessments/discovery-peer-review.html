A discovery peer review is a 2-hour informal review of a team's work in the [discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works).  

 

It's a way to get feedback and recommendations at the end of this phase. All discoveries in DfE are required to have one. 

 

It's not an assessment. There are no assessments at discovery.

## Why have one 

 

A discovery peer review will give reassurance to confirm whether you: 

 

- have understood what the problem is and priorities for the team 

- should move into the alpha phase 

 

After the review, the team will get a report with a [RAG (red, amber or green) rating](/service-assessments/peer-review-report#peer-review-rag-ratings), practical recommendations, and advice. It will not result in a pass or fail. It will not stop a team from progressing. 

 

But remember, if research shows that it's better to stop at the end of discovery, this is not a failure. The team will be saving time and money that could be better spent elsewhere. 

 

### What a team gets out of having a review 

 

If the assessors have recommendations for the team, these will be detailed in the report. The team can then decide on how they want to act on the recommendations. This could mean having a follow-up call or a workshop. 

 

Use the report to the team's advantage. Communicate recommendations with stakeholders or use it to prepare for the next phase of delivery. 

 

## When to book 

 

When you start your discovery, you should plan to [book your peer review](/book) so that it happens near the end of discovery. 

 

However, you should request this at least 5 weeks in advance so the service assessment plus team has time to arrange a panel. 

 

## Outcome of a discovery peer review 

 

You'll receive an email when the report is ready to read. This should happen around 3 days after the peer review takes place. 

 

The assessor panel will support the team with any recommendations made. Go [your peer review report](/service-assessments/peer-review-report) for details about receiving a report and acting on recommendations.
