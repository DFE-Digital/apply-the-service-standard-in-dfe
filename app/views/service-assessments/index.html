In DfE, all services need to have a service assessment. Getting assessed is a condition of your Cabinet Office
spend approval.

This includes:

- transactional
- non-transactional, and
- information services

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private beta and public beta phases. If you are in the discovery phase,
you should have a [peer review](/service-assessments/discovery-peer-review).

Read the guidance for [what counts as a transactional service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard#what-counts-as-a-transactional-service).

A service may be assessed by a panel of people from across government or within DfE.


## Cross-government panel service assessment 

You need a cross-government panel assessment if your service or product is: 

- a transactional service with over 100,000 transactions per year, or 
- users are from more than one public sector organisation 

The service assessment plus team will work with CDDO (Central Digital and Data Office) to arrange the panel of cross-government assessors.  


Book a cross-government service assessment by emailing the <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">service assessment plus team</a>. 


## DfE panel service assessment 

You need a DfE panel assessment if your service or product is:

- transactional and will have less than 100,000 transactions per year
- non-transactional
- an information service 

The panel will be made up of people from across professions in DfE. 

Book a DfE panel service assessment by emailing the <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">service assessment plus team</a>. 

## Peer reviews 

You need an end-of-phase peer review if your service or product is in the discovery phase

The outcome of a discovery peer review will be a report sharing what the team has done well and what they need to improve.  
 
Book a discovery peer review by emailing the <a href="mailto:serviceassessment.plus@education.gov.uk">service assessment plus team</a>. 

If you would like a mid-phase peer review at the alpha or beta phase, you can arrange one as a team with DDaT colleagues. 

They can be a useful way to get feedback and recommendations as you prepare for a service assessment.
