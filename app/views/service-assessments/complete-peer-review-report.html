During the peer review, work together with the rest of the panel to gather your findings and recommendations. 

Do this in a way that suits you. For example, use a shared Word doc or the panel chat in Slack. 

## Draft the report

### For discovery peer reviews

During the peer review, consider the practical tips in [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) against standards 1 to 7 in the discovery phase. This will help you understand if the team has done what they need to do to mark the end of discovery. 

Although a team in discovery won't yet have made tech choices, they should, if relevant, show an understanding of existing options. 

Make sure you consider feedback on the positive aspects of the discovery too, not only on recommendations on what to improve. 

The report should aim to conclude whether the team has understood the problem space and priorities for next steps following the end of discovery. 

If the team has not yet reached a decision on next steps, the report will give feedback and recommendations based on the evidence shared at the peer review. 

You should aim to complete the discovery peer review report within 3 days.

### For alpha and beta peer reviews

The report should document what the team has done well and what the team could improve. You can use the [Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) as a guide to provide recommendations. 

Think about how the report can support the team to either explore things further or move into the next phase. 

Acknowledge any constraints or business requirements the team is working to. 

Once the panel is happy with the notes, add them to the final report in the service. This is usually done by the lead assessor, but the panel can add their findings individually. 

You should aim to complete the alpha or beta peer review report within 7 days.


## Submit the report 

It's the lead assessor's responsibility to submit the report to the service assessment plus team for final checks before it's shared with the service team. 

If the team accepts the report and there are recommendations the panel has offered to support, the team will be in touch. This could mean having a follow-up call or giving advice on a workshop, depending on the recommendations. 

If the team challenges the report, they'll raise any issues with the service assessment plus team, who'll set up a meeting with the panel.
