A service assessment measures a service against the [14 points of the GOV.UK Service Standard](/service-standard). It's a space for service teams to get expert advice from a panel of specialists. 


## Why have one 
 

All transactional services need to have an assessment. Getting assessed is a condition of your cabinet office spend approval.  

Read the guidance for [what counts as a transactional service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard#what-counts-as-a-transactional-service).

 
## When to book a service assessment  

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private and public beta and live phases.  

You should request a service assessment at least 5 weeks in advance so that the service assessment plus team has time to arrange an assessor panel.

If youâ€™re in discovery, you should book a [discovery peer review](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review). This will help the team to understand what the problem is, priorities and whether to move into alpha. 

 [Book a service assessment](/book). 

## Cross-government panel assessment  

If your service has over 100,000 transactions per year or users are from more than one government department, the panel will consist of cross-government assessors. 

Some non-transactional services may also need to be assessed by a cross-government panel. The service assessment plus team can advise on this when you book your assessment. 

 

## DfE panel assessment  

If your service has under 100,000 transactions per year, the panel will consist of DfE assessors.  

If your service is non-transactional, it could have a [peer review](/service-assessments/alpha-beta-peer-review).  

   
## Outcome of a service assessment  

You'll receive an overall [RAG (red, amber or green) rating](/service-assessments/service-assessment-report#service-assessment-rag-rating-descriptions) for the assessment within 4 working days. 

You'll then receive a detailed report within 7 working days. Go to [your service assessment report](/service-assessments/service-assessment-report) for report details and how to act on recommendations.
