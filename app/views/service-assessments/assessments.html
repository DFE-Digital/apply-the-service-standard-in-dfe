A service assessment measures a service against the [14 points of the GOV.UK Service Standard](/service-standard). It's a space for service teams to get expert advice from a panel of specialists. 


## Why have one 
 

All transactional services need to have an assessment. Getting assessed is a condition of your cabinet office spend approval.  

Read the guidance for [what counts as a transactional service](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard#what-counts-as-a-transactional-service).

 
## When to book a service assessment  

Service assessments happen at the end of alpha, private and public beta and live phases.  

You should request a service assessment at least 5 weeks in advance so that the service assessment plus team has time to arrange an assessor panel.

If youâ€™re in discovery, you should book a [discovery peer review](/service-assurance/discovery-peer-review). This will help the team to understand what the problem is, priorities and whether to move into alpha. 

 [Book a service assessment](/book). 

## Cross-government panel assessment  

If your service has over 100,000 transactions per year or users are from more than one government department, the panel will consist of cross-government assessors. 

Some non-transactional services may also need to be assessed by a cross-government panel. The service assessment plus team can advise on this when you book your assessment. 

 

## DfE panel assessment  

If your service has under 100,000 transactions per year, the panel will consist of DfE assessors.  

If your service is non-transactional, it could have a [peer review](/service-assessments/alpha-beta-peer-review).  

## What to prepare for a service assessment

Think about the best way to tell the story and show the work of the phase the team is in. This could be a mixture of Lucid boards, docs, and sketches. 

You can create a slide deck but remember to show the actual work done to build the service, rather than lots of pre-prepared slides. Use slides to set the context for example, but keep the deck to a minimum. 

Review the practical tips by phase in [Apply the Service Standard in DfE](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard) to help you prepare. 

## What to expect during a service assessment 

### After you request an assessment 

You'll receive an email with next steps. This includes how to share links to artefacts for the panel to read. For example, strategy docs, Lucid boards, design histories, or slide decks. 

You can add links to work in progress, to give the panel an idea of what you've done so far. 

### One to 2 days before 

The team will have a Teams call with the panel. This is a chance for everyone to meet and agree on what will happen during the assessment. 

For larger projects, user research, design, and tech will also have pre-assessment calls with the relevant assessors. 

### On the day 

Service assessments are usually 4 hours but can vary. Some services may need less time, whereas larger services may need more. You can discuss your needs with the service assessment plus team as part of booking.  

Someone from each discipline within the team should attend. It can be of value for the rest of the team to attend as silent observers. 

The panel usually includes a user researcher, designer (depending on the service, this could be content, interaction, or service design), tech assessor, and product or delivery manager. 

There may also be silent observers from DfE or cross-government for learning and development opportunities. 

How you want the assessment to run is for you to agree with the panel. For example, you could agree to have a 45-minute show and tell, followed by sections to cover the problem area, users, hypotheses, and measures of success. 

It's up to the team to decide whether you have questions throughout or at the end of the assessment. You can discuss this with the panel on the pre-assessment call. 

### After the assessment 

You'll receive a detailed report within 7 working days. 

The report will include an overall [RAG (red, amber, green) rating](/service-assessments/service-assessment-report#service-assessment-rag-ratings) for the service, plus a RAG rating for each of the [14 points of the Service Standard](https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard), feedback and any actions. 

Go to [your service assessment report](/service-assessments/service-assessment-report#assessment-report-rag-ratings) for report details and how to act on recommendations.
