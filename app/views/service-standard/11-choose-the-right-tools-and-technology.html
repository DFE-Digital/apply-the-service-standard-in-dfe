## Summary

Choose tools and technology that let you build a good service in an efficient, cost effective way.

Build a sustainable service which allows you to change direction in future.

Detailed guidance of how to meet this standard can be found in <a href='https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/#dfe-architecture' rel="noopner noreferrer">DfE Architecture guidance</a> and <a href='https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/guides/default-technology-stack/'  rel="noopner noreferrer">DfE Technical Guidance</a>.

## Why it's important 

When you make a decision about technology, you're making a significant investment.  The choices you make will have a huge impact on your ability to create, iterate and operate the service in a flexible, sustainable way.

It's important to make sure you're not working on your own and use learnings from other teams or services where possible. Always try to align technology choices with other DfE teams. The more common components that are created and used the more efficient you can be in building a great service that meets the Service Standard. 

When you make a decision about tools, look across DfE to see what's currently being used. <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/share-and-reuse-technology' rel="noopner noreferrer">Align with tools</a> being used across other DDaT communities as much as possible.

## How to meet this standard in every phase

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you are working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

#### Things to consider:

- evidence that the team have considered different options to how the service will be delivered technically and the rationale for the chosen technical direction
- technology choices are technically feasible and <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/security/SitePages/assurance.aspx" target="_blank">security assured (opens in new tab)</a>
- the tools the team will be using and why they are value for money 
- how the tools and technology you choose meet <a href="https://design.education.gov.uk/accessibility/standards">accessibility standards </a> , including <a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/'>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> 
- any constraints with legislation, contracts or technology that impact on the service
- align technology choices with the recommended <a href="https://technical-guidance.education.gov.uk/guides/default-technology-stack/" rel="noopner noreferrer">tech stack</a> used across DfE, where possible
- a working prototype, technical spikes, or proof of concept - using the chosen tools and technology - has been built and tested to prove that the architecture is fit for purpose
- architectural artefacts, <a href="https://dfe-digital.github.io/architecture/standards/architecture-documentation/#architecture-documentation" rel="noopner noreferrer">decisions</a> and plans have been documented, shared across your community and reviewed and assured
- evidence that the team will continue to re-evaluate and challenge previous decisions as new requirements are discovered
- demonstration that <a href='https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-technology-sustainable' rel="noopner noreferrer">technology choices are sustainable</a> longer term

  ## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
