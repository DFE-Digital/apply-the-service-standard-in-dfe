## Summary

Consider where your service fits in your users' journey and whether you can solve a whole problem or influence a wider solution.  

Collaborate across teams, programmes and other services to create a service that meets users' needs across all channels in the end-to-end journey. For example, if users have to come in and then out of the service again to reach their end goal, what would that look like.

## Why it's important

People often don't know how education services fit together. It helps if you can bring things together into a journey which makes sense to users, irrespective of which organisation they belong to or channel they use.

You may not be able to fix a whole problem, but you may be able to improve it and support or influence a wider solution.

## How to meet this standard in every phase

You'll be assessed on what you've done to meet this standard at <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessments</a>. However, even if the service you're working on is not being assessed, it's good practice to consider how you'll meet this standard point.

## In discovery

### Things to consider:

- <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/scoping-your-service" target="_blank">an understanding of the problem space (opens in new tab)</a> and whether the proposed alpha addresses the full problem or leaves gaps
- whether there are services that exist that solve some - or the same - problem and how this service would fit in with existing services to solve a whole problem
- design and research to collaborate with policy and other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/working-across-organisational-boundaries" target="_blank">teams who are delivering services (opens in new tab)</a> for similar users
- an understanding of policy constraints and crossover with other services or DfE content

## In alpha

### Things to consider:

- evidence of where the service touches other services and whether you've spoken to those teams
- speaking to teams working on similar services to share knowledge of the types of users, user research carried out or design work done to meet user needs
- how the team will talk through an end-to-end journey at a <a href='/service-assessments/'>service assessment</a>
- an understanding of non-digital or off-line processes and their impact or relationship to the service
- how the service fits in with other channels or services relevant to your user group
- if you are providing a service to schools which will be used by people who use other DfE services, consider how to make the service consistent in the look and feel, the language used, and the tone of voice
- how the service will look and feel like other DfE services that are part of the same user journey
- creating a map of the current user journey, pain points and what the user journey will look like
- how to make it easy for users to focus on the next step in a journey. For example, how to navigate their way through the service to help them achieve their goal
- how the concepts being tested avoid duplication
- join together other relevant services or DfE content to solve a whole problem

## In beta and live

### Things to consider:

- using research and private beta analytics to show the service works. Demonstrate, with evidence, how users can get through the end-to-end journey unaided, especially during public beta
- collaborating with teams that make part of the end-to-end service
- an understanding of - and research for - the full end-to-end journey, including online and offline journeys and GOV.UK content
- how support, including assisted digital channels, are working
- how users will know about the service, does it have a starting point on GOV.UK? 
- offline processes and user support, including <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2011/07/28/an-introduction-to-assisted-digital/" target="_blank">assisted digital (opens in new tab)</a> routes, have been designed and tested, particularly at public beta
- an understanding of non-digital or off-line processes and their impact or relationship to the service
- user support process is in place 

## Profession specific guidance

Each DDaT profession in DfE has their own community and guidance.
